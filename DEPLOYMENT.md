# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing Vercel Configuration**: Added `vercel.json` with proper build and routing configuration
2. **Bundle Size Optimization**: Implemented code splitting to reduce main bundle from 5.3MB to 282KB
3. **API Dependencies**: Fixed API imports that were causing deployment failures
4. **Build Process**: Optimized Vite configuration for production builds

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files:
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `.vercelignore` - Files to exclude from deployment
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - This deployment guide

### Modified Files:
- `vite.config.ts` - Added code splitting and build optimizations
- `api/*.ts` - Fixed imports and added fallback responses for serverless environment
- `package.json` - Added `@vercel/node` dependency

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect the build configuration from `vercel.json`

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
   - Add any required environment variables:
     - `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
     - `VITE_ZEROG_PRIVATE_KEY` (optional)
     - `VITE_ZEROG_RPC_URL` (optional)

## Build Output

The optimized build now produces:
- **Main bundle**: 282KB (down from 5.3MB)
- **Vendor chunks**: Properly separated for better caching
- **Static assets**: Optimized CSS and polyfills

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:
- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/balance` - Mock balance (0G services not available in serverless)
- `POST /api/chat` - AI chat with fallback responses
- `GET /api/traffic-analytics` - Traffic analytics with mock data

## Notes

- 0G services are disabled in serverless environment (Vercel functions)
- API endpoints return mock/fallback data when 0G services are unavailable
- The app will work with basic traffic functionality without 0G integration
- For full 0G functionality, consider deploying to a Node.js server environment

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check that the build command `npm run build` completes successfully locally
